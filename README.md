# RISC-V FPGA Project

This repository contains the Vitis project files for implementing a RISC-V processor on an FPGA. The project enables control of various peripherals, including:

- **RGB LEDs**: Multiple RGB LEDs can be controlled individually.
- **Switches**: Configurable input switches for custom functionalities.
- **LEDs**: General-purpose LEDs for output indications.

## Features
- Implementation of a RISC-V processor using Vitis and Vivado.
- Control logic for managing RGB LEDs, switches, and standard LEDs.
- Designed for educational purposes and demonstration of RISC-V capabilities on FPGA platforms.

## Files Included
- `design_1_wrapper.xsa`: Hardware design for the FPGA.
- `platform/`: Platform-specific configurations.
- `xil_types.h`: Header files for FPGA development.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rojinatefimehr/RISC-V_FPGA.git
